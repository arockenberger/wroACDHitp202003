|       |your environment is a temporary one, data are transient|
|       |![CoLab](./v_img/20200812_07_GoogleCoLab_15.png)|
|       |okay now you are set|
|       |go through notebook, walk your way down|
|       |![CoLab](./v_img/20200812_07_GoogleCoLab_16.png)|
|       |execute python scripts, push play button|
|       |![CoLab](./v_img/20200812_07_GoogleCoLab_17.png)|
|       |after script has been executed, a running number shows|
|       |you are allowed to jump back and execute code fragments in any order you see fit|
|       |![CoLab](./v_img/20200812_07_GoogleCoLab_18.png)|
|       |notice, console output (print and such) appear under code fragment|
|       |this output is stored in notebook a most liked feature by me|
|       |![CoLab](./v_img/20200812_07_GoogleCoLab_19.png)|
|       |result is stored into json file available in files section again|

|       |download transient file|
|       |![CoLab](./v_img/20200812_07_GoogleCoLab_21.png)|
|       |open with your editor of choice, mine is vscode here on Windows|
|       |![CoLab](./v_img/20200812_07_GoogleCoLab_22.png)|
|       |output is machine friendly|
|       |![CoLab](./v_img/20200812_07_GoogleCoLab_23.png)|
|       |with extension Beautify it's easy to `Format Document` human friendly|
|       |![CoLab](./v_img/20200812_07_GoogleCoLab_24.png)|
|       |much better, isn't that cool|
|       |![CoLab](./v_img/20200812_07_GoogleCoLab_25.png)|
|       |search for `suspicious`|
|       |notice dates are supposed to be chronological|
|       |clearly `2` is off, here caused by text recognition error|
|       |![CoLab](./v_img/20200812_07_GoogleCoLab_26.png)|
|       |same for the second batch|
|       |![CoLab](./v_img/20200812_07_GoogleCoLab_27.png)|
|       |ui, date `2` is clearly incorrect|
